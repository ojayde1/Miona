                      <p class="text-muted mb-0" style="text-align: justify;">We are always thrilled to share the newest advice with you when it comes to fashion, especially when it pertains to African fashion. One of the top continents for creating the best and most attractive styles is Africa. Since we Africans determine the patterns that other people imitate, 
                         it would be irrational if we didn't appear to be 'in' that fashion. </p>
